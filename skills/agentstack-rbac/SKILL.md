# AgentStack RBAC — Roles and Permissions

Enables managing **role-based access control** (RBAC) in AgentStack: assigning roles, updating user roles in projects, listing users by role, and understanding permissions. Roles are project-scoped; permissions control what users can do within a project.

## When to use

- User asks for "roles", "permissions", "RBAC", "access control", "who can do X", "assign role", "check permission", or "project member role".
- User wants to give or change a user's role in a project (member, admin, etc.).
- User wants to list project users and their roles or filter by role.
- User needs to enforce "only admins can…" or "members can read, editors can write" style logic.

## Why RBAC matters

- **Project-scoped:** Each project has its own roles and members; same user can have different roles in different projects.
- **Consistent with 8DNA:** Permissions and role metadata can live in project `data` or backend; MCP and API use the same model.
- **Combine with Buffs:** Use buffs for temporary elevation (e.g. trial with extra permissions); use RBAC for stable roles.

## Capabilities (MCP tools relevant to RBAC)

| Tool | Purpose | Returns / notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `auth.assign_role` | Assign a role to a user (optionally scoped to project). | — |
| `projects.get_users` | List users in the project; filter by `role` (e.g. admin, member). | Users and their roles. |
| `projects.add_user` | Add user to project with a **role** (e.g. member; Professional tier). | — |
| `projects.update_user_role` | Change a user's role in the project. | — |
| `projects.remove_user` | Remove user from project (revoke access). | — |

Full RBAC (create_role, list_roles, check_permission) may be available via backend API; see **MCP_SERVER_CAPABILITIES** and RBAC docs in the repo.

## Instructions

1. **Assign or change role:** Use `auth.assign_role` (user_id, role, optional project_id) or `projects.update_user_role` (project_id, user_id, role) for project membership role.
2. **List users by role:** Use `projects.get_users` with `project_id` and optional `role` filter to see who has which role.
3. **Add user to project with role:** Use `projects.add_user` (project_id, role, user_id or email); requires Professional subscription.
4. **Revoke access:** Use `projects.remove_user` (project_id, user_id).
5. **Check permission in code:** Use backend API or SDK (e.g. check_permission, getAvailablePermissions) as documented in the repo; MCP focuses on role assignment and listing.

## Examples (natural language → tool)

- "Assign admin role to user 42 in project 1025" → `projects.update_user_role` with `project_id: 1025`, `user_id: 42`, `role: "admin"` (or `auth.assign_role` with project_id).
- "List all admins in project 1025" → `projects.get_users` with `project_id: 1025`, `role: "admin"`.
- "Add user as member to project 1025" → `projects.add_user` with `project_id: 1025`, `role: "member"`, and user identifier.
- "Change user 42 to editor in project 1025" → `projects.update_user_role` with `project_id: 1025`, `user_id: 42`, `role: "editor"`.
- "Remove user 42 from project 1025" → `projects.remove_user` with `project_id: 1025`, `user_id: 42`.

## Tips

- Default project roles often include owner, admin, member, viewer; exact set depends on project config. Use `projects.get_users` to see current roles.
- `projects.add_user` / `projects.remove_user` require Professional subscription.
- For custom roles and permission checks (create_role, check_permission), use the backend API or SDK; see repo RBAC docs.
